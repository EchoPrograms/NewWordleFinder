# Descriptions
Just some code I made to find the next wordle answers

# Instructions
- go to [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) (any nytimes.com site works, due to the API being CORS protected)
- click CTRL+SHIFT+I to open the chrome dev tools console
- paste in the code from index.js and hit enter
This will then list out the next ~31 or so wordle answers, (not including the current day's)
